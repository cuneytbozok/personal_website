      I help enterprises modernize operations by leading discovery, defining
      target-state architecture, and making fit-to-standard decisions that
      balance out-of-the-box capabilities with purposeful customization. My
      focus spans ITSM/CSM delivery, CMDB/CSDM alignment, Virtual Agent
      experiences, and API integrations across ERP and automation ecosystems
      (i.e., SAP, UiPath, Microsoft Teams, Slack).
    </p>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-text-muted sm:text-lg">
      I lead end-to-end engagements from maturity assessment and phased roadmap
      definition through architecture design, integration patterns, and
      rollout. Recent work includes headless telco marketplace architecture,
      AI-powered email automation, Now Assist and Agentic AI enablement, and
      executive-ready discovery artifacts. I produce durable
      foundations—architecture blueprints, HLDs/LLDs, ADRs, and API
      contracts—so delivery teams and stakeholders stay aligned.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-text-muted sm:text-lg">
      Beyond delivery, I conduct internal ServiceNow trainings, facilitate
      architecture workshops with integrators and vendors, and participate in
      senior-level technical interviews to raise hiring quality and delivery
      standards.
