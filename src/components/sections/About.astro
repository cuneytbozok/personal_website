      I help enterprises modernize operations by designing platforms that
      automate work, integrate systems, and scale safely. I specialize in
      GenAI adoption, conversational experiences, and governance—ensuring
      solutions are not only shipped, but adopted and maintainable.

      I lead end-to-end delivery from discovery and roadmap definition through
      architecture, integration design, and rollout. My recent work includes
      AI-powered email automation, virtual agent experiences, multilingual
      enablement, and API-led integrations across ERP and automation ecosystems
      (e.g., SAP, UiPath, Microsoft Teams). I focus on building durable
      foundations—clear patterns, guardrails, and documentation—so teams can
      evolve the platform confidently over time.
