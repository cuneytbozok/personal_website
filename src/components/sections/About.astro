        I help enterprises modernize operations by leading discovery, defining
        target-state architecture, and making fit-to-standard decisions that
        balance out-of-the-box capabilities with purposeful customization. My
        focus spans ITSM/CSM delivery, CMDB/CSDM alignment, Virtual Agent
        experiences, and API integrations across ERP and automation ecosystems
        (i.e., SAP, UiPath, Microsoft Teams, Slack).
      </p>
      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-text-muted sm:text-lg" data-motion="reveal" data-motion-delay="100">
        I lead end-to-end engagements from maturity assessment and phased roadmap
        definition through architecture design, integration patterns, and
        rollout. Recent work includes headless telco marketplace architecture,
        AI-powered email automation, Now Assist and Agentic AI enablement, and
        executive-ready discovery artifacts. I produce durable
        foundations—architecture blueprints, HLDs/LLDs, ADRs, and API
        contracts—so delivery teams and stakeholders stay aligned.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-text-muted sm:text-lg" data-motion="reveal" data-motion-delay="140">
        Beyond delivery, I conduct internal ServiceNow trainings, facilitate
        architecture workshops with integrators and vendors, and participate in
        senior-level technical interviews to raise hiring quality and delivery
        standards.
